Magento
=======
This repository contains some useful tips, code snipnets and hacks all related to magento..

Most of the times, I used one of these to solve some issue or complete some project...

I will try commenting the code and version on which it worked for me....

I got no legal responsibility of any code I provide in this repository

Changes are always welcome
